# Security Document
See also [code conventions](code-conventions.md); there are a few guidelines
about security of added code there.

## Reporting security issues
Security issues are reported as anything else. Authors should indicate that
they are security issues, so that the team knows to prioritize testing them.

## Team guidelines
Everyone with push access must use two-factor authentication for their Github
accounts. Should their account still be compromised, other team members should
be immediately notified via Discord.
